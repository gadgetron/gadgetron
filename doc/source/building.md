# Building the Gadgetron


## Setting up a development environment

The Gadgetron project uses [conda](ttps://conda.io) to manage dependencies. To set up a build environment, make sure you have [conda installed](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and then:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate gadgetron
```

and you are ready to work with the Gadgetron codebase.
